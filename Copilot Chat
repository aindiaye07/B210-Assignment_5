aindiaye07: Write a user-defined function that compares average tip amount to whether a customer is a smoker.

GitHub Copilot: I'll read the current `analyze_tips.py` to see existing code and where best to add the new function; expected outcome: file contents so I can make a minimal, well-integrated change. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/Aissatou%20Ndiaye/Downloads/analyze_tips.py)

I'm going to write a small plan (todo list), then add a new `compare_avg_tip_by_smoker` function into `analyze_tips.py` with a usage example and run a quick syntax check. Expected outcome: `analyze_tips.py` contains the new function and an example; syntax errors (if any) reported. 

Created 3 todos

Now I'll create the function and example by updating `analyze_tips.py`. After that I'll run the project's error checker to validate syntax. Expected outcome: file updated and error report returned. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
I'll run the workspace error checker to catch any syntax/type errors in the new file. Expected outcome: report PASS/FAIL for errors. 

Checked [](file:///c%3A/Users/Aissatou%20Ndiaye/Downloads/analyze_tips.py), no problems found

Completed (1/3) *Implement comparison function*

I'll add a small, well-documented function to `analyze_tips.py` that computes average tip for smokers vs non-smokers and (optionally) runs a Welch t-test. I updated the file and ran a syntax check — no errors were found.

What I changed
- Created `c:\Users\Aissatou Ndiaye\Downloads\analyze_tips.py`
  - Added function `compare_avg_tip_by_smoker(records, do_ttest=False)`:
    - Accepts a pandas DataFrame (if pandas is installed) or an iterable of dict-like records.
    - Computes counts and average tip for smoker and non-smoker groups.
    - Returns a dictionary with n_smoker, n_non_smoker, avg_tip_smoker, avg_tip_non_smoker, difference (smoker - non-smoker).
    - If `do_ttest=True` and scipy is available, includes `ttest_pvalue` (Welch t-test).
  - Included a minimal example dataset under `if __name__ == '__main__'` that prints a summary.

Usage examples
- Quick script run (from PowerShell):
```powershell
python "c:\Users\Aissatou Ndiaye\Downloads\analyze_tips.py"
```
- From another script / REPL:
```python
from analyze_tips import compare_avg_tip_by_smoker

data = [
    {'tip': 3.0, 'smoker': 'No'},
    {'tip': 5.0, 'smoker': 'Yes'},
    # ...
]

summary = compare_avg_tip_by_smoker(data, do_ttest=True)
print(summary)
```

Notes and small assumptions
- The function normalizes the `smoker` field: accepts booleans or strings like 'Yes'/'No', 'Y'/'N', 'True'/'False', '1'/'0' (case-insensitive). Unknown values are ignored.
- Non-numeric tip values are skipped.
- If pandas is installed and a DataFrame is passed it looks for columns named exactly 'tip' and 'smoker'.
- If `do_ttest=True` but scipy is not installed, `ttest_pvalue` will be None (no error thrown).
- The function uses Python's stdlib `statistics.mean` for averages.

If you'd like, I can:
- Add type hints that accept a DataFrame type when pandas is installed.
- Add unit tests (pytest) for happy path and edge cases (missing fields, empty groups).
- Add an option to return group-level summary statistics (median, stddev, IQR) or visualization (matplotlib) and a README.

Would you like me to add tests or extend the output with more statistics/plotting?

Made changes.
